F-16 Flight Control Simulation (Scripts) 1.0

F-16 Flight Control Simulation (Scripts) Publisher's description

Running the model requires:
1. a joystick
2. the FlightGear simulator (can be downloaded for free at www.flighgear.org)
3. the MATLAB/Simulink Aerospace blockset

!!!ALL FILES HAVE BEEN CREATED WITH MATLAB/SIMULINK 7.5 AND ARE UNTESTED ON OLDER VERSIONS!!!

Both the F-16 aerodynamic model and the control laws have been taken from:

NASA Technical Paper 1538 "Simulator Study of Stall/Post-Stall Characteristics of a Fighter Airplane With Relaxed Longitudinal Static Stability", Dec. 1979, by Nguyen et al.
Downloadable from the NASA Technical Report server.

Installing and running the model:
1. Unzip all files
2. Plug in and calibrate the joystick
3. Start up MATLAB/Simulink 7.5 or higher with Aerospace blockset installed
4. Open ¡°F16_fcs.mdl¡± and generate ¡°runfg.bat¡± using the generate runscript block (select the correct FlightGear directory)
5. Open runfg.bat outside MATLAB/Simulink, this will start up FlightGear and load the F-16 graphics (use ¡°V¡± to change your viewpoint)
6. Back in MATLAB/Simulink type ¡°runF16fcs¡± and press enter
7. Provide requested information, pressing enter again will start the simulation
8. Switch to FlightGear and start flying

The F-16 dynamic model is valid for 

1. Altitudes up until 10000 meters
2. subsonic speeds
3. angle of attack between -20 and 90 deg
4. angle of sideslip of ¡À30 deg.

The F-16 model can also be downloaded separately with more documentation at mathworks. 

System Requirements:
